	<h2 class="title">My Philosophy</h2>
	<div class="story" style="display: flex; align-items: center;"> 
	  <div>
		<p>As an educator, my teaching philosophy centers on creating a supportive, engaging, and inclusive classroom environment where every student feels valued and motivated to learn. I believe that effective teaching goes beyond delivering content; it involves understanding the unique needs of each student and forming a sense of community and mutual respect. To achieve this, I draw on key educational theories that guide my approach to classroom management and student engagement.</p>

	<h2 class="title">Glasser's Choice Theory</h2>
	<div class="story" style="display: flex; align-items: flex-start; gap: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px;">
	  <p style="flex: 1;">
		Glasser's Choice Theory plays a significant role in shaping my classroom practices. This theory suggests that all behavior is a choice and that our actions are motivated by the desire to satisfy five basic human needs: survival, love and belonging, power, freedom, and fun. I use this understanding to help students become more aware of their choices and encourage them to take responsibility for their actions. By creating a learning environment where these needs are met, I aim to reduce behavioral issues and promote positive behavior. For instance, I design activities that provide a sense of belonging and fun while giving students the freedom to express themselves, fostering a more cooperative and motivated classroom atmosphere.

	<h2 class="title">Dreikurs' Goal Theory</h2>
	<div class="story" style="display: flex; align-items: flex-start; gap: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px;">
	  <p style="flex: 1;">
		Additionally, I incorporate Dreikurs' Goal Theory to address and understand student misbehavior. Dreikurs suggests that when students' fundamental needs for belonging and meaningful participation in a group are not met, they may engage in mistaken goals, such as seeking undue attention, exerting power, seeking revenge, or avoiding failure. By recognizing these underlying motivations, I am better equipped to address the root causes of misbehavior rather than merely managing its symptoms. I strive to build a classroom culture where each student feels they belong and contribute meaningfully, thus preventing these mistaken goals from arising in the first place.
